HOMEWORK1


I love their idea of everyone empowering and exploring data and by knowing themselves, interacting with data and working on it.
In fact it is true that in companies there are different roles having their own works but by having this type of platform may help 
all the employees to having knowledge on everything to be frank after listening this podcast I have shared this with my collogues 
and they were surprised that their work has become easy in some part of their project and the tutorials were great on the website. 
This open source platform can be very useful with many open examples helping students to think diversly.


1)	**Title**  : Women in space 
    **URL**.   : [LINK] (https://observablehq.com/@ralucanicola/women-in-space)
    **Description** : For Women's History Month DataViz Contest I wanted to create a chart that provides small     
                insights into the history of women that travelled to space. This chart shows the 65 women with completed spaceflights. 
                As a comparison, there are around 500 men that travelled to space until now, but this chart is not about a comparison between
                women and men. It's about looking at these 65 women spacefarers and admiring their amazing accomplishments.

2)	**Bubble chart** : it is a variation of a scatter chart in which bubbles are used>
3)	I choose this project for the visualization they used. I liked the background representing their title about space and different types of circles they used for explanation of the data.
4)	As I said the chart was like a eyefeast for me. I was randomly scrolling suddenly the visual effects on the chart grabed my attention and also using bubble chart for the background they selected was a good choice.
